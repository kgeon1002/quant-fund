Welcome to Quant Fund, a robust open-source project built for researchers, developers, and practitioners in the field of quantitative finance. This project is part of the 量化开源基金会, a community dedicated to transparent, reproducible, and collaborative finance research. The goal is simple: provide a clear, usable, and scalable toolkit that helps you design, test, validate, and deploy quantitative strategies. This README walks you through what the project is, how it works, how to contribute, and how to get the most from the toolkit. The content here uses plain language, practical examples, and a focus on real-world workflows.

If you are looking for the Releases page to grab installers or prebuilt assets, you can navigate to the Releases section of this repository. The assets on that page are designed to make setup quick and predictable across major operating systems. The Release page also serves as a central place to review version history, fixes, and new features. See the link above for the latest assets and notes. For quick access, you will find two visible references to the same URL in this document: the first at the very top, and the second as a badge that links to the same page.

About Quant Fund

Quant Fund is a modular software stack for quantitative research, backtesting, risk analysis, and light live trading. It blends data ingestion, feature engineering, model evaluation, execution interfaces, and reporting into a coherent platform. The project emphasizes transparency and reproducibility. Every result should be traceable to data, code, and configuration. The framework aims to be accessible to students, researchers, and professionals, while remaining flexible enough for advanced users to extend.

量化开源基金会 is the guiding principle behind this work. The organization centers on open science, collaboration, and responsible development in quantitative finance. The project welcomes contributions from researchers, developers, students, and practitioners. We believe that sharing research, code, and data strengthens the field and accelerates progress. This README reflects that ethos with careful attention to clarity, reproducibility, and practical value.

Core Concepts and Philosophy

- Reproducibility first. Every model, backtest, and result should be reproducible given data, code, and configuration. We encourage deterministic seeds, versioned data, and clean dependency management.
- Modularity. The system divides into clear modules for data, models, backtesting, risk checks, and reporting. Each module is replaceable without breaking the rest of the system.
- Extensibility. Users can add new data adapters, new model classes, and new visualization methods without touching core code. Plugins and adapters follow a simple contract.
- Safety and governance. We provide audit trails for backtests and live runs. Users can export reports to share with stakeholders without exposing sensitive data.
- Accessibility. The toolkit targets a broad audience. It ships with sensible defaults, robust error messages, and comprehensive documentation.

What you can build with Quant Fund

- Strategy research: test ideas quickly against historical data, visualize outcomes, and compare strategies on standardized metrics.
- Portfolio construction: explore risk-based allocations, factor models, and optimization routines.
- Risk management: monitor drawdown, volatility, and exposure; build safety checks for live deployments.
- Data engineering: integrate datasets from multiple sources, align them by timestamps, and keep provenance intact.
- Research notebooks and reports: generate reproducible reports that combine code, results, and commentary.

Architecture Overview

Quant Fund is designed with a layered architecture. Each layer has a well-defined API and can be replaced or extended independently.

- Data Layer: Adapters that fetch, clean, and align data from various sources. Supports historical market data, fundamentals, macro indicators, and synthetic datasets for testing.
- Feature Layer: Tooling to derive signals, indicators, and engineered features. Includes rolling statistics, time-series transforms, and domain-specific features.
- Modeling Layer: A collection of model templates for backtesting and evaluation. Supports traditional factors, machine learning models, and custom strategies.
- Backtesting Layer: A deterministic engine that simulates trades over historical data with calendar-aware logic and slippage modeling.
- Risk & Compliance Layer: Modules for risk checks, exposure limits, and performance attribution. Provides charts and summaries for governance reviews.
- Execution & Live Layer: Interfaces to order management, brokers, and simulated markets. Supports dry-run, paper trading, and live trading with safeguards.
- Reporting Layer: Dashboards, notebooks, and export options. Generates performance reports, dashboards, and publication-ready figures.
- Orchestration Layer: A CLI and API to connect modules, configure experiments, and manage experiments across runs.

Getting Started

- Prerequisites: Python 3.9 or later, a modern package manager (pip, poetry, or conda), and a reasonable amount of disk space for data.
- Installation: Clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install dependencies. Use a clean environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages.
- Quick test: Load a small sample dataset and run a basic backtest to confirm the setup works on your machine.

Getting Hands-On: Example Workflows

Workflow 1: Quick Backtest of a Simple Moving Average Crossover

- Load daily price data for a set of instruments.
- Compute short and long moving averages as features.
- Define a simple crossover rule: go long when the short MA crosses above the long MA; exit when it crosses below.
- Run a backtest over a defined period.
- Generate performance metrics and a visualization.

Workflow 2: Risk-Aware Portfolio Allocation

- Build a universe of assets.
- Compute risk parity or minimum-variance allocations.
- Backtest with realistic transaction costs and slippage.
- Assess risk-adjusted performance using Sharpe ratio, Sortino, and maximum drawdown.
- Validate robustness with walk-forward testing.

Workflow 3: Data-Driven Signals with Simple ML

- Prepare features from price data and fundamentals.
- Train a baseline model to predict next-period returns.
- Use a risk-aware selection mechanism to build a portfolio.
- Backtest with out-of-sample validation and model monitoring.

Notes for Beginners

- Start small. Use a small data set and a simple strategy to learn the workflow.
- Keep everything versioned. Track your configuration, data, and results together.
- Focus on reproducibility. Ensure that anyone can reproduce your backtests with the same seeds and data.

Advanced Topics

- Factor modeling: Build multi-factor strategies, test factor tilts, and explore risk budgeting.
- Portfolio optimization: Explore constraint handling, turnover control, and transaction costs.
- Live risk monitoring: Connect to a live data feed and set automated risk checks to pause trading when risk exceeds thresholds.

Architecture Details and Design Rationale

- Data Layer: Adapters implement a common interface. They translate raw sources into a standardized internal format. Each adapter records metadata: source, timestamp, version, and quality flags.
- Feature Layer: Features are stateless transformations that can be composed. A registry helps you locate features by name or category.
- Modeling Layer: Models implement a common scoring interface. You can use rule-based models or trainable models. All models expose a standard fit, predict, and score API.
- Backtesting Layer: The engine uses a deterministic clock and discrete events. It handles order fills, position sizing, and cash management. It can simulate different market conditions by toggling slippage and commissions.
- Risk Layer: Provides a suite of metrics: drawdown, trailing drawdown, volatility, beta, and beta-adjusted returns. It can generate risk dashboards and export reports.
- Execution Layer: Abstracts the trade interface. It supports simulated trading, paper trading, and live trading if configured. All trades are logged with timing and slippage data.
- Reporting Layer: Visualizes performance and risk. It exports plots, tables, and markdown reports suitable for review meetings or publication.
